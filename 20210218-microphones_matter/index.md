These sound different! The laptop mic has _tons_ of room noise. I
think the Bose headphones are trying hard to do clever signal
processing which reduces background noise but also makes my voice more
muted and a little robotic in places. The Yeti is pretty good but
still picks up some unintended nearby sounds despite being in
directional mode.

# Intuition, action, and luck (and Harry Potter)

When work is going well, it feels good. It feels playful. Not like
following a plan or map, but exploring freely with only the loosest
sense of a destination in mind, until you find you've solved your
problem. It feels [like][] the [luck potion][] from the Harry Potter
world:

It's good to have this sense of "feeling at peace with the world" and
trying things even when you don't know for sure, consciously, how
they'll help. It's following your intuition in the sense of
[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning][].

It's also doing things because of "how very pleasant" they could be.
It's a bias toward action–playful action–and trying things that are
[worth doing even if they fail][].

There aren't any luck potions, but [luck favors the prepared mind][].
This kind of intuition-guided flow state isn't a consistent method,
but it's nice when it happens.

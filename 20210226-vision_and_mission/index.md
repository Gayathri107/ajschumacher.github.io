# Vision and Mission


### Increasing the awareness of the universe

I build and share understanding of the world to improve life for the
people I love most, and for everyone. I learn from others and from the
world, communicating and educating in turn to engage growth. I build
systems that contribute to these processes. I make improvements every
day to myself, my relationships, and the world around me.

I was [inspired][] to "refine" my personal [mission][] statement, but
I had to make one first. I like brief [vision][] statements so I came
up with one of those as well.

I particularly like the vision, which can include lots of things I'm
interested in, including research, data science, and education.
There's a connection to [Vonnegut][] as well:

What is the purpose of life?

To be
the eyes
and ears
and conscience
of the Creator of the Universe,
you fool.

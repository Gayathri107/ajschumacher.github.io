<title>Ulysses' compass</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>These are some <a href="big.html">slides</a> for a book club discussion of
Chapter 7 from McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking</a>. See also
McElreath's own <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019">slides and video presentations</a>.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>&#128009; Scylla of overfitting
  &#9973; Ulysses' compass &#129517;
&#127786; Charybdis of underfitting</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>The title of the chapter is "Ulysses' Compass." McElreath loves to
give his chapters cute names that don't necessarily mean anything to
you until you've read the chapter.</p>
<p>What do we value: simplicity or accuracy? The chapter is about
navigating between overfitting and underfitting, which McElreath notes
briefly (page 201) is related to but distinct from the bias variance
trade-off. I think the difference he's alluding to is about what a
model is <em>capable</em> of representing (bias/variance) vs. what it <em>does</em>
represent (under/overfitting).</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="overfitting" src="overfitting.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>In section 7.1, "The problem with parameters" is that too many can
make it easy to overfit. It's a fairly standard presentation of
overfitting via polynomial regression and hating on R<sup>2</sup> (or
any naive score on the training data).</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python">from math import log

# Truth (as in Problem 7E1)
p = [0.7, 0.3]  # heads, tails</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So now it's time to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>. Here we go!</p>
<p>This section was the most interesting to me, so I'm going to spend
some time on it here. I felt like his explanations were helpful, and
I've encountered the material in less cogent ways previously, so I
appreciated the chance to think things through all together a bit.</p>
<p>I'll do a running example where the true probabilities of heads and
tails for a coin (say) are 0.7 and 0.3. (We never really know the true
probabilities.)</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Entropy, H(p)
H = lambda p: -sum(p_i * log(p_i) for p_i in p)
H(p)  # 0.6108643020548935</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So we get entropy, which measures how uncertain things are. (He gives
some motivating criteria and implies it could be derived.)</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Candidate "models"
q = [0.5, 0.5]
r = [0.9, 0.1]</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So say we have these two "models" for that coin.</p>
<p>(These are just point estimates, not whole posterior distributions.)</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Cross-Entropy, H(p, q), xH here because Python
xH = lambda p, q: -sum(p_i * log(q_i) for p_i, q_i in zip(p, q))
xH(p, q)  # 0.6931471805599453
xH(p, r)  # 0.764527888858692</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Cross-entropy tells us something about how well a model goes with the
truth. (Well; how un-well: lower scores are better.)</p>
<p>The best score is what you get using the true model, which is the
entropy of the true model.</p>
<p>In lots of my models, we use cross-entropy loss, and we generally just
implicitly round all the "true" probabilities to one or zero, or do
something nearly as unjustified.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># KL Divergence, D(p, q)
D = lambda p, q: sum(p_i * log(p_i/q_i) for p_i, q_i in zip(p, q))
D(p, q)  # 0.08228287850505178
D(p, r)  # 0.15366358680379852</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Divergence then is just cross-entropy with the entropy subtracted off,
so that the best you can do is zero.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># D(p, q) = H(p, q) - H(p)
D(p, q) == xH(p, q) - H(p)  # True</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>The other one doesn't happen to come out exactly due to floating point
math; what luck that the first one does!</p>
<p>So we wish we could use divergence to evaluate models, but we can't
because we never really know the true underlying model <code>p</code>. All we get
are data.</p>
<p>(If instead we're assuming that all the data is really 100% likely,
then H(p) is 0 and there's nothing to subtract off.)</p>
<p>The key insight in general is that even if we don't know <code>p</code>, when we
compare two models' scores by subtracting them, the <code>p</code> goes away, so
we can still get relative scores even without <code>p</code>.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Data
d = [0, 0, 1]  # heads, heads, tails</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So here are some data.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Log probability (likelihood) score
S = lambda d, p: sum(log(p[d_i]) for d_i in d)
S(d, q)  # -2.0794415416798357
S(d, r)  # -2.513306124309698</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So we switch now to just using the sum of log likelihoods of the data
given the model as the model's score.</p>
<p>This score is the same as the "cross-entropy" I often use, which is
the same also as divergence, when we're saying all the true
probabilities are zero or one.</p>
<p>Higher scores are better here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Positive log likelihoods happen!</p>
<hr>
<p>Positive log likelihoods caused me a little bit of consternation,
because I'd been thinking in terms of probabilities rather than
probability distributions. But really when you have a distribution,
you're using a density, which can be greater than one. So the log
could be positive.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># True vs. predictive
S(d, p)  # -1.917322692203401
S(d, [2/3, 1/3])
         # -1.9095425048844388</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>The true model isn't necessarily the one that scores best on a given
sample of data.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Deviance
deviance = lambda d, p: -2 * S(d, p)
S(d, p)         # -1.917322692203401
deviance(d, p)  #  3.834645384406802</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Then it's also common to switch to deviance, to make something nice
happen with chi-squared distributions or something. Now smaller scores
are better.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Regular</em>ization!</p>
<hr>
<p>From the information theory stuff, he really wants to develop
information criteria, but first he talks about regularization.</p>
<p>He points out that it's sort of about pulling out the "regular"
patterns in the data, rather than overfitting to chance patterns. Nice
little mnemonic.</p>
<p>Bayesians are pretty smug about regularization, because they get it
essentially for free by adjusting their priors.</p>
<p>The chapter also has some material on robust regression, which
Bayesian's are also pretty smug about because it's relatively easy for
them to just swap out the normal distribution for something with
fatter tails.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="silly meme" src="silly_meme.png"></p>
<hr>
<p>Next it's on to "Predicting predictive accuracy." McElreath talks a
little bit about cross-validation, but it's pretty clear his true love
is information criteria.</p>
<p>I generally prefer (read: "actually use") cross-validation.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>AIC: Akaike Information Criterion</li>
<li>BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion (aka Schwarz criterion)</li>
<li>CV: Cross-Validation</li>
<li>DIC: Deviance Information Criterion</li>
<li>lppd: Log Pointwise Predictive Density</li>
<li>PSIS: Pareto-smoothed importance sampling cross-validation</li>
<li>R^2: "variance explained" or "coefficient of determination"</li>
<li>WAIC: [Widely Applicable | Watanabe-Akaike] Information Criterion</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So he talks about his favorites, PSIS and WAIC. They seem fine.</p>
<hr>
<p>compare but don't select</p>
<hr>
<p>Then he says not to do model selection, in the sense of throwing out
models and what you learned from them in the process.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code># Mine (Python)
def sum_log_prob(a, b):
    return max(a, b) + math.log1p(math.exp(0 - abs(a - b)))

# McElreath's (R)
log_sum_exp &lt;- function( x ) {
    xmax &lt;- max(x)
    xsum &lt;- sum( exp( x - xmax ) )
    xmax + log(xsum)
}</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Little sidebar (as also McElreath had one): Multiplying probabilities
that you have the logs of is easy, because you just add the logs.
Adding log probabilities is more annoying. But you can be a little
clever about it and it works out! I needed this recently while playing
with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox">St. Petersburg paradox</a>.</p>
<p>Mine is based on a <a href="https://gasstationwithoutpumps.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/sum-of-probabilities-in-log-prob-space/">post from Kevin Karplus</a>. I found McElreath's on
a <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/rmcelreath/rethinking/src/R/distributions.r">post on rdrr</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ulysses' compass</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't overfit</li>
<li>Use log likelihood</li>
<li>Use CV and/or IC</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So that about wraps it up!</p>

<title>The Pragmatic Programmer</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read the original <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/">Pragmatic Programmer</a> years ago, and now read
the 20th anniversary edition with some of my colleagues. It was an
important book to me early in my career, and still has lots of useful
reminders and updates with the new edition.</p>
<p>I wish the whole book was available as pages on the public web. It's
"written as a series of self-contained sections" in a way that would
work really well with hyperlinks.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch1"></a>Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy</h3>
<hr>
<p>The "broken windows" terminology hasn't aged terribly well because of
the controversy around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows policing</a>; I agree broadly
with the software development message, but the term has some unwanted
connotations.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio" (page 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "Knowledge Portfolio" metaphor is pretty good. I also want people
to be life-long knowledge investors.</p>
<p>They list five items in managing a knowledge portfolio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest regularly</li>
<li>Diversify</li>
<li>Manage risk</li>
<li>Buy low, sell high</li>
<li>Review and rebalance</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"While there's a glut of short-form essays and occasionally reliable
answers on the web, for deep understanding you need long-form
books." (page 16)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"A favorite consulting trick: ask "why?" at least five times." (page
18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/09/curiosity">Why Curiosity Matters</a> they reference "Toyota&#8217;s 5 Whys approach."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the Neuro Linguistic Programming suppositions is "The
meaning of your communication is the response you get."" (page 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch2"></a>Chapter 2: A Pragmatic Approach</h3>
<hr>
<p>They note "Meyer's <em>Uniform Access principle</em>," which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">states</a> that
"All services offered by a module should be available through a
uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented
through storage or through computation."</p>
<p>In Python this doesn't have to mean exposing getters and setters;
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property">@property</a> is a good solution.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>If it isn't easy, people won't do it.</em>" (page 38)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In fact, this book is written in Markdown, and typeset directly
from the Markdown source." (page 45)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How? How do they do footnotes, etc.? Sounds like ConTeXt can do some
part... But presumably they have their own custom stuff. Lots of
details, I imagine.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Model building can be both creative and useful in the long term.
Often, the process of building the model leads to discoveries of
underlying patterns and processes that weren't apparent on the
surface." (page 67)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"During the calculation phase, you get answers that seem strange.
Don't be too quick to dismiss them. If your arithmetic is correct,
your understanding of the problem or your model is probably wrong.
This is valuable information." (page 68)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch3"></a>Chapter 3: The Basic Tools</h3>
<hr>
<p>The footnote on page 100 cites <a href="http://pignottia.faculty.mjc.edu/math134/homework/doodlingCaseStudy.pdf">What Does Doodling do?</a>, which seems
kind of neat. I don't completely trust the result in the paper though,
or at least the interpretation. Here's the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doodling is a way of passing the time when bored by a lecture or
telephone call. Does it improve or hinder attention to the primary
task? To answer this question, 40 participants monitored a
monotonous mock telephone message for the names of people coming to
a party. Half of the group was randomly assigned to a &#8216;doodling&#8217;
condition where they shaded printed shapes while listening to the
telephone call. The doodling group performed better on the
monitoring task and recalled 29% more information on a surprise
memory test. Unlike many dual task situations, doodling while
working can be beneficial. Future research could test whether
doodling aids cognitive performance by reducing daydreaming</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch4"></a>Chapter 4: Pragmatic Paranoia</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"DBC [Design By Contract] is more efficient (and DRY-er) than
defensive programming, where <em>everyone</em> has to validate data in case
no one else does." (page 108)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"By expressing the domain of the square root function in the
precondition of the <code>sqrt</code> routine, you shift the burden of
correctness to the caller&#8211;where it belongs." (page 110)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And other "fail fast" kinds of things... "crashing early" etc...</p>
<hr>
<p>In Python, <code>with open</code> blocks help implement "Finish What You Start"
(page 118).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch5"></a>Chapter 5: Bend, or Break</h3>
<p>This chapter is <em>very substantially</em> different from the original
version, and in interesting ways. Here's a quick summary of the
content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decoupling</li>
<li>Events<ul>
<li>Finite State Machines</li>
<li>The Observer Pattern</li>
<li>Publish/Subscribe</li>
<li>Reactive Programming and Streams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Functional programming</li>
<li>Don't use inheritance<ul>
<li>Interfaces and protocols</li>
<li>Delegation</li>

<blockquote>
<p>"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to
everything else in the Universe." (page 130, quoting John Muir, My
First Summer in the Sierra)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 148, they list files such as <code>dry.pml</code> which I guess means
they write using "Pragmatic Markup Language" as their custom
Markdown...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do you program in an object-oriented language? Do you use
inheritance?</p>
<p>"If so, stop! It probably isn't what you want to do." (page 158)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch6"></a>Chapter 6: Concurrency</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Concurrency] is often implemented using things such as fibers,
threads, and processes." (page 169)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science)">fibers</a>. Cute name. Connected to coroutines
(cooperative multitasking). Seems like fibers is common terminology in
Ruby.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... messaging systems (such as Kafka and NATS)" (page 189)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATS_Messaging">NATS</a>. It's a messaging system. According
the <a href="https://docs.nats.io/faq">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"NATS stands for Neural Autonomic Transport System. Derek Collison
conceived NATS as a messaging platform that functions like a central
nervous system."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch7"></a>Chapter 7: While You Are Coding</h3>
<hr>
<p>"Testing is not about finding bugs, it&#8217;s about getting feedback on
your code: aspects of design, the API, coupling, and so on. That means
that the major benefits of testing happen when you think about and
write the tests, not just when you run them." (page 325)</p>
<hr>
<p>"If you&#8217;re not sure why it works, you won&#8217;t know why it fails." (page
339)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tip 68: Build End-to-End, Not Top-Down or Bottom Up" (page 366)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Testing, design, coding&#8212;it&#8217;s all programming." (page 374)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Property-based testing seems like fuzzing...</p>
<hr>
<p>That NIST thing on having reasonable password rules:
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch8"></a>Chapter 8: Before the Project</h3>
<p>This is good stuff, but I didn't pull out specific notes. It's on
working in tight feedback loops rather than trying to "collect
requirements" all at the beginning.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch9"></a>Chapter 9: Pragmatic Projects</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Programmers are a bit like cats: intelligent, strong willed,
opinionated, independent, and often worshiped by the net." (page
437)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tip 85: Schedule It to Make It Happen" (page 441)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324959836_Mythical_Unit_Test_Coverage">Mythical Unit Test Coverage</a>
is neat. Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is a continuous struggle to understand how much a product should
be tested before its delivery to the market. Ericsson, as a global
software development company, decided to evaluate the adequacy of
the unit-test-coverage criterion that it had employed for years as a
guide for sufficiency of testing. Naturally, one can think that if
increasing coverage decreases the number of defects significantly,
then coverage can be considered a criterion for test sufficiency. To
test this hypothesis in practice, we investigated the relationship
of unit-test-coverage measures and post-unit-test defects in a large
commercial product of Ericsson. The results indicate that high
unit-test coverage did not seem to be any tangible help in producing
defect-free software."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even though your title might be some variation of &#8220;Software
Developer&#8221; or &#8220;Software Engineer,&#8221; in truth it should be &#8220;Problem
Solver.&#8221; That&#8217;s what we do, and that&#8217;s the essence of a Pragmatic
Programmer. We solve problems." (page 464)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anonymity, especially on large projects, can provide a breeding
ground for sloppiness, mistakes, sloth, and bad code." (page 466)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch10"></a>Chapter 10: Postface</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tip 99: Don&#8217;t Enable Scumbags" (page 472)</p>

<title>Thinking Cards</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Inspired by <a href="/2013/09/28/polyas-how-to-solve-it-quotes-and-comments/">How to Solve It</a>, <a href="/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a>, and others,
I've started to collect tactics for problem-solving. The shuffling
stuff is so that you can easily choose a random tactic to try.</p>
<p>I might do more with this and I'd love feedback/suggestions;
<a href="#contact">comment or message me</a>!</p>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#1" name="1">1</a>. Embrace problems</h3>
<p>The word "problem" has a negative connotation, and some problems are
hard to love. But in general, problems make life more interesting and
give us opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Keep your problems
close.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#2" name="2">2</a>. Take care of yourself</h3>
<p>Are you hungry? Tired? Stressed? Eat well, sleep well, and look after
your mental health. Try to do something right now to make your body
and mind more effective, like stretching.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#3" name="3">3</a>. Take the pressure off</h3>
<p>What can you do to approach the problem calmly? Should you ask for
help or otherwise communicate with others? Should you make a back-up
plan or adjust your goal?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#4" name="4">4</a>. Reinforce the positive</h3>
<p>You have an opportunity for growth. You're learning. Celebrate all
progress, even small progress. Feel good about what you're doing. You
can do this.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#5" name="5">5</a>. Remove distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off the TV. Turn off your phone. Turn off notifications. Don't
check the news. Multitasking is a lie. If other thoughts come, jot
them down elsewhere to return to later.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#6" name="6">6</a>. Get inspired</h3>
<p>Why are you working on this? What's the larger goal? What are the
larger benefits? What other problems or people have done work you
admire? Appreciate and aspire to greatness.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#7" name="7">7</a>. Make a plan</h3>
<p>If you know how to attack the problem, make a plan to do that. Even if
you don't, make a plan to spend time on the problem, not all at once,
but consistently over a longer period.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr>
<h3><a href="#8" name="8">8</a>. Do other things</h3>
<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep, but also, spend time on complementary
and even unrelated tasks. Read a book. Tutor a student. Revisit other
things. Take a walk.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">

<title>Add variance to achieve a given correlation</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>If you have data <em>x</em> and you want some data <em>y</em> that has a given
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">correlation</a> <em>r</em> with <em>x</em>, multiply <em>x</em> by the sign of <em>r</em> and then
add random noise with variance equal to the original variance over the
square of the desired correlation, minus the original variance.</p>
<p>You can do this in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, for example:</p>
<!-- set.seed(27)  -->

<pre><code class="language-r">correlated &lt;- function(x, r) {
  return(x * sign(r) + rnorm(length(x), sd=sqrt(var(x)/r^2 - var(x))))
}

x &lt;- rnorm(100)
cor(x, correlated(x, 0.75))
## [1] 0.7537228</code></pre>

<p>The resulting correlation is only equal to the desired value in
expectation; you can tweak a value in the result to make it more exact
if you like, or use a <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-April/128925.html">more sophisticated method</a>.</p>
<p>The method here works because of the relationship between correlation
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">coefficient of determination</a> which holds here, and of course
the <a href="/20201030-the_variance_sum_law_is_interesting/">variance sum law</a>.</p>
<p>\[ r^2 = R^2 = 1 - \frac{ \sigma^2_\text{noise} }{ \sigma^2_{x + \text{noise}} } = \frac{ \sigma^2_x }{ \sigma^2_x + \sigma^2_\text{noise} } \]</p>
<p>\[ \sigma^2_\text{noise} = \frac{\sigma^2_x}{r^2} - \sigma^2_x \]</p>
<p>The question of how to do this came up years ago at an old job I had.
I don't recall anybody coming up with a solution, back then. Live and
learn!</p>
<p>If you're generating all the data yourself, it's easier to use a
multi-dimensional random generator. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html">MASS</a> package's <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-53/topics/mvrnorm">mvrnorm</a>
function has an <code>empirical</code> flag which can even make things work out
exactly (rather than just in expectation). And if you need more new
variables that relate to existing data, you probably want a
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-April/128925.html">more sophisticated method</a>.</p>

<title>Correlation can be confounder determination</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>In a situation of pure confounding (<em>x</em>&#8592;<em>z</em>&#8594;<em>y</em>) with equivariant
noise, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">correlation</a> between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">coefficient of determination</a> between <em>z</em> and either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em>:
\( r = R^2 \).</p>
<p>I got to thinking about this because of <a href="/20200917-book_of_why/">The Book of Why</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stoddard_Burks">Burks</a>] computed the direct effect of parental IQ on children's
IQ and found that only 35 percent, or about one-third, of IQ
variation is inherited. In other words, parents with an IQ fifteen
points above average would typically have children five points above
average." (page 306)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That works out if we have a simple data-generating model like this in
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>:</p>
<!-- set.seed(10)  -->

<pre><code class="language-r">z &lt;- rnorm(1000000, sd=1)            # genetics,            variance=1
x &lt;- z + rnorm(1000000, sd=sqrt(2))  # IQ of parents,  adds variance=2 noise
y &lt;- z + rnorm(1000000, sd=sqrt(2))  # IQ of children, adds variance=2 noise
mean(y[0.9 &lt; x &amp; x &lt; 1.1])
## [1] 0.334556</code></pre>

<p>One third of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> variance is due to <em>z</em>, and when <em>x</em> values
are around 1, average corresponding <em>y</em> value is around 1/3, so that
checks out: regression to the mean.</p>
<p>The genetic contribution <em>z</em> isn't really observable, though. All we
see are <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. So how do we get the contribution of <em>z</em>?</p>
<p>Both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> <a href="/20201030-the_variance_sum_law_is_interesting/">have</a> variance 3. If we had a twin study in this
world, we could recover that variance is 2 when genetics is fixed, and
that would let us find that genetics explains 1/3 of variance. But we
don't generally have a twin study.</p>
<p>The common thing to do would be a regression.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">summary(lm(y ~ x))  # (Pulling out one line of output...)
## Multiple R-squared:  0.1114,     Adjusted R-squared:  0.1114</code></pre>

<p>This is usually interpreted as saying that <em>x</em> explains 11% of the
variation of <em>y</em>. That's true enough, but it isn't how much is
explained by <em>z</em>.</p>
<p>The correlation between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, however, <em>is</em> how much variance
is explained by <em>z</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">cor(x, y)
## [1] 0.3338363</code></pre>

<p>More generally (for non-equivariant noise) the regression coefficient
gives the fraction of variance explained by <em>z</em>. (See also the earlier
estimate illustrating regression to the mean.)</p>
<p>So this is a way of estimating the effect of an unobserved confounder,
which seems to work in this very simple setting. Is this like what
Burks did? Probably her models were not so simple. Is this a special
case of some more general approach?</p>
<p>I don't think I've seen this kind of "method" before; I'd love to see
more elaboration of this kind of idea for estimating impacts of
unobserved variables.</p>
<p><img alt="confounding" src="common_cause.png"></p>
<p>The data-generating model above (and surrounding discussion) requires
suspension of disbelief; it represents some sort of asexual
reproduction, has additional influences on IQ that are entirely
uncorrelated between parents and children, and of course IQ is fraught
as a topic to begin with. Hopefully the statistical considerations are
still visible.</p>

<title>Take notes like Paul Halmos</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos">Paul Halmos</a> recommended taking minimalist notes and then later
expanding the notes from memory. This lets you pay more attention in
the moment and then exercise your recall afterward, which is good for
memory. Paired with speech-to-text transcription, you can also avoid
the risk of missing anything.</p>
<p>Here's how Halmos explained note-taking in his automathography:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lecture courses are a standard way of learning something&#8211;one of the
worst ways. Too passive, that's the trouble. Standard
recommendation: take notes. Counter argument: yes, to be sure,
taking notes is an activity, and if you do it, you have something
solid to refer back to afterward, but you are likely to miss the
delicate details of the presentation as well as the big picture, the
Gestalt&#8211;you are too busy scribbling to pay attention. Counter
counter-argument: if you don't take notes, you won't remember what
happened, in what order it came, and, chances are, your attention
will flag part of the time, you'll daydream, and, who knows, you
might even nod off.</p>
<p>"It's all true, the arguments both for and against taking notes. My
own solution is a compromise: I take very skimpy notes, and then,
whenever possible, I transcribe them, in much greater detail, as
soon afterward as possible. By very skimpy notes I mean something
like one or two words a minute, plus, possibly a crucial formula or
two and a crucial picture or two&#8211;just enough to fix the order of
events, and, incidentally, to keep me awake and on my toes. By
transcribe I mean in enough detail to show a friend who wasn't
there, with some hope that he'll understand what he missed." (Paul
Halmos, "I want to be a mathematician")</p>

<title>Cattell didn't say we process words faster than pictures</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McKeen_Cattell">James Cattell</a> wrote: "experiments I have made show that we can
recognise a single colour or picture in a slightly shorter time than a
word or letter, but take longer to name it."</p>

<p>That sentence points to footnote 34:</p>

within 1/1,000th of a second. See <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Essentials+of+Assessing%2C+Preventing%2C+and+Overcoming+Reading+Difficulties+-p-9781118845240">this book</a>, p. 30."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That book is
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/-p-9781118845240">Essentials of Assessing, Preventing, and Overcoming Reading Difficulties</a>,
and the relevant paragraph on page 30 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"James Cattell published a paper in 1886 demonstrating a newly
developed timing mechanism that could measure reaction times to
within 1 millisecond (i.e., 1/1,000th of a second). With this level
of precision, he discovered that the reaction times for reading
printed words like <em>chair</em> or <em>tree</em> were faster than reaction times
for naming a chair or a tree when shown a picture of those items.
Thus, over 125 years ago, there was evidence that naming objects and
naming written words were not the same skills, contrary to our
intuitions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That 1886 paper is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article-abstract/os-XI/41/63/2888375">The Time it Takes to See and Name Objects</a>. The
paper is under three pages long. It doesn't convince me that Cattell
had millisecond precision in his measurements, and it's not
principally about comparing words and images. There's one relevant
paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The time required to see and name colours and pictures of objects
was determined in the same way. The time was found to be about the
same (over &#189;sec.) for colours as for pictures, and about twice as
long as for words and letters. Other experiments I have made show
that we can recognise a single colour or picture in a slightly
shorter time than a word or letter, but take longer to name it. This
is because in the case of words and letters the association between
the idea and name has taken place so often that the process has
become automatic, whereas in the case of colours and pictures we
must by a voluntary effort choose the name. Such experiments would
be useful in investigating aphasia."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't explained in the paper, but I have to imagine he measured
recognition as distinct from naming via some mechanism like tapping
when you see a picture of a tree, for example.</p>
<p>So the consistency of the quotes above with the Cattell source depends
on what it means "to process." If it means "to name," then it's
consistent. But if it means "to recognize," which I think is more
natural, then it doesn't convey the result Cattell published.</p>
<p>I think this is all fascinating; I'd love to learn about more recent
research on this topic.</p>

<title>The Economics of Star Trek, by Webb</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read the print version of the <a href="https://medium.com/@RickWebb/the-economics-of-star-trek-29bab88d50">blog post</a>, which delivers on the
fun of thinking about a world with the economics of the Star Trek
future. In the end you can't expect scifi to deliver economic
salvation, but imaginative inspiration is a fine starting point for
learning and thinking more.</p>
<p>I didn't really find Webb's guesses to constitute a workable system,
though I can't really say whether the problem is his, Star Trek's, or
the failure of my imagination.</p>
<p>There's also an even more serious book on this topic: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekonomics">Trekonomics</a>,
by Manu Saadia.</p>
<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>"If you don't believe that nothing is forever, if you don't believe
that society and humans can change, then you do not believe in the
future (and, incidentally, you do not believe in the past either)."
(page 11, in Manu Saadia's Foreward)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The one thing the show gets right is violence.</p>
<p>"I would point to a recent book by Stanford historian Walter
Scheidel: <em>The Great Leveler: Violence and The History of Inequality
from the Stone Age to the Twenty First Century</em> (Princeton
University Press, 2017). Professor Scheidel's thesis is that
throughout human history, only violence and war have truly managed
to solve economic conflicts&#8211;and even more so when economic
inequality got out of control, whether in pre-modern agrarian
societies or during the turbulent and genocidal last century.
Western Europe's prosperity rose out of the ashes and gas chambers
of World War II. The war annihilated the old social hierarchies on
the Continent, capitalists who happily collaborated with the Nazis
were cast out of society and expropriated, thus removing the main
opposition to expansive social safety net and to the modern welfare
state. Former enemies began to cooperate and to coordinate, first
economically and later politically. The European Union grew out of
the War, it was a project borne out of the resistance to Nazism. The
same is true of the post-war economic order (mostly, the
Bretton-Woods accords shepherded by John Maynard Keynes) and of the
United Nations. It is important to remember that all these were
noble yet practical projects, conceived and imagined by idealists
while the war was raging on and its outcome was still very much in
the balance. If anything this proves that there is value in
imagination and idealism, especially in times of great upheaval. One
must always be ready." (pages 12-13, in Manu Saadia's Foreward)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a strange mix of dark and light...</p>
<p>(In Star Trek, many advances happened following
<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Eugenics_Wars">The Eugenics Wars of the 1990s</a>.)</p>
<p>Webb also opines on page 141 that "the sense lingers that if we <em>are</em>
to arrive at a Trek vision of the future, we might have to go through
our own version of The Eugenics Wars to get there."</p>

<p>Interesting bit on page 90 about a UBI study showing it increased
divorce rates (which people took as a bad thing, I think) but then
later it turned out the divorce result was a statistical error.</p>

<p>John Kenneth Galbraith's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affluent_Society">The Affluent Society</a> is referenced on
pages 134-135 as a text whose "arguments can be said to underpin [the]

<title>Game Changer, by Solomon and Blumberg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I picked this up because of the subtitle, "How to be 10x in the talent
economy." I'm interested in human <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/174">differences in productivity</a>. The
<a href="https://www.harpercollinsleadership.com/game-changer/">book</a> had little to say on the technical side, but emphasized
balancing "hard" and "soft" skills, with a big focus on continual
improvement via feedback and coaching. The book is largely an
advertisement for the authors' businesses (10x <a href="https://www.10xmanagement.com/">management</a> /
<a href="https://10xascend.com/">ascend</a>) and I think fairly effective as such.</p>
<p>I've worked in a couple companies with variations on the theme of
having a "career manager" and a "project manager," sometimes the same
person, which can engender conflicts of interest. Solomon and
Blumberg's talent management model essentially outsources your career
management to an independent firm, which is interesting. It could be
viewed as a kind of <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837">matrixing</a> that extends beyond company borders.</p>
<p>Another way of viewing it is as starting your own consultancy but
outsourcing lead generation (and some other functions, like contracts)
to Solomon and Blumberg. That removes a major difficulty of going it
alone, if it works well. There are still trade-offs associated with
working 1099 vs. W-2 jobs; better health insurance options etc. would
still help more people make the leap toward greater independence from
corporations.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>The authors give a quantitative example early on to make "10x" real:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Two weeks later, Nicole returned to our office with the news that
she had let go of no less than thirty-three of her thirty-six-person
team. <em>More than 90 percent.</em> She was sorry to lay off that many
fine workers and was quick to mention that they were well taken care
of, but there was no way around this one simple fact: Our three
recommended 10xers could deliver a better, stronger, more
sustainable product than thirty-three or even a hundred engineers
who were just "very good."" (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some interesting conversation to be had about labor relations,
the future of work, and what direction we really want to move in, I
think.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the new talent economy, everybody you deal with better be 10x,
or at least striving to be." (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Great talent becomes 10x when it develops the quality of
<em>manageability</em>&#8211;the ability to seek out and internalize powerful
outside guidance, built on an insatiable desire for growth and
improvement." (page xx)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... they do it because <em>they love the doing of it</em>&#8211;it's the most
important thing you can know about 10xers." (page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the future will see work and learning blend into one." (page
14, quoting <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2019/01/02/solving-future-skills-challenges/">The Key To Solving Future Skills Challenges</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 16 they reference
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success">The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazon's success</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>They speak positively about Objectives and Key Results (<a href="https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/">OKRs</a>)...
Maybe I should try those?</p>
<hr>
<p>They have a neat <a href="https://10xascend.com/calculator/">Lifestyle Calculator</a> for considering 24 different
priorities in considering a job.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you see a door, what do you do? Do you break it down, kick it
open? Or do you go under it, over it? I need people who consider
every possibility, who can't just look at a thing for what it
usually is. They find strategic solutions from every angle. If you
can't do that, then you're the kind of person that gets stuck, and I
don't have time to help you when you do." (page 34, quoting Jesse
Lee)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Addiction, self-sabotage, procrastination, laziness, rage, chronic
fatigue, and depression are all ways that we withhold our full
participation in the program of life that we are offered." (page 43,
quoting Charles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eisenstein#The_More_Beautiful_World_Our_Hearts_Know_is_Possible">Eisenstein</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Chapter 3, "Success and Sabotage&#8211;The Manageability Continuum," is
largely about growth via feedback, and hiring for people who can do
that.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cost of a bad hire is incalculable, and not just from a
financial perspective." (page 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""I don't think you can fix a temper. For the bottom 10 percent,
sabotage is just so ingrained in their personality. And I'm not a
big fan of performance improvement plans. Ninety-five percent of the
time, they're not going to make it, and if they do make it, you're
just excusing the fact that they're not really the right person for
the job because you don't want HR to be upset. It's very unusual for
someone from that lower 10 percent or 15 percent to suddenly become
a top 10 percent. At best you can move them into the middle group
where they can contribute without getting in the way."</p>
<p>"Goldsmith is far more optimistic about the 80 percent in the
middle, those with mixed impulses. "<em>They</em> can change. I've seen
examples when great leaders have been put in place that inspire
previously unsuccessful teams and individuals."" (pages 58-59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""The biggest change was...the leader worked hard to help the
individuals on that team to <em>change their mindset.</em>"" (page 59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""I ask potential new hires one question: <em>'On a scale of one to
ten, how weird are you?'</em> And I never hire lower than a seven.""
(page 59, quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On pages 62-63, they highlight three interview questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How well did the potential 10xer handle a significant mistake of
   their own making?</li>
<li>How does the potential 10xer handle a situation where a boss or
   client wants something he or she thinks is a bad idea?</li>
<li>What does the potential 10xer identify as their biggest
   professional weaknesses?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>On page 70 they talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window">Johari window</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""In fact, I believe that in the future we're going to look back and
say that what we did before genetic engineering was barbaric and
like playing a genetic lottery on our children."" (page 125, quoting
Bryan Bishop)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book doesn't say much of anything about genetic contributions to
being "10x" and this quote isn't intended to be related to that topic,
but the concept is sort of uncomfortably in the background somehow...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... once you lose the talent war, you completely limit a company's
ability to compete and excel." (page 140)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"After all, the difference between management and leadership is
huge." (page 142)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am humbly and strongly requesting your feedback. We have a lot of
contact on an ongoing basis and I am really focused on learning more
about my weaknesses, blind spots, or other areas that need
meaningful improvement." (page 164)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Part of some recommended language for soliciting feedback.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no
one else can see."" (page 187, quoting Arthur Schopenhauer)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 200, they talk about what they call a "L.E.A.P. doc" which is
an employment List of Expectations and Priorities, which they suggest
sending as a kind of first move in negotiating employment. An
interesting idea.</p>

<title>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, by Bennett</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've recommended this 1908 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day">book</a> since <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">2010</a>/<a href="/20160320-books_for_professionals/">2011</a>, and I
thought I'd revisit it. The sexist language makes it hard to continue
recommending; I'd love to see a modern version.</p>
<p>The main message I take from this reading is the need to slow down,
when trying to do more. Reflect. Think. It's not packing as much as
possible into the time you have, it's getting as much as you can out.
As with eating, the good life isn't just quantity per time.</p>
<p>I relate aspects of this book to more recent <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">ideas</a> about
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">learning</a> and memory, which I also think are good. Many of the
charming aspects of the book relate to the <em>why</em> more than the <em>how</em>
of learning, and try to encourage the reader to believe that they
<em>can</em> find the time to do more. (A modern version might reference
statistics on <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-spending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01">screen-watching</a>, and find that people have a lot of
time that might be better spent.)</p>
<p>Taken mildly, Bennett's advice is to get a hobby, to develop an
interest, aligned with "cultivation of the mind." Taken more
seriously, he encourages more purposeful, joyful, and "examined" life.
I can get behind both sentiments.</p>

<title>The Variance Sum Law is Interesting</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The <a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/2/glossary/variance_sum_law.html">Variance Sum Law</a> is simple enough that it's often given
without explanation, but I think it's interesting enough that it
deserves a little thought.</p>
<p>The Variance Sum Law says that for two independent random variables
\( A \) and \( B \) with variances \( \sigma_A^2 \) and \(
\sigma_B^2 \), the sum \( A+B \) has variance \( \sigma_{A+B}^2 =
\sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \).</p>
<p>Explaining an application of this, you might consider an example: say
\( a = 10 \) and \( b = 3 \).</p>
<p>This kind of example is used in at least one course to introduce
<a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/2/2.5">analysis of variance</a>. After introducing the \( 13 = 10 + 3 \)
part, they continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Although the derivation isn't as simple as it seems, the
decomposition holds for the sum of the squared distances, too."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's possible to find a <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~joel8/resources/ConceptualPresentationResources/VarianceSumLaw.pdf">derivation</a>, but they're generally not very
satisfying. And you know that the sum of squares is not the same as
the square of the sum: \( 13^2 \neq 10^2 + 3^2 \) because \( 169
\neq 109\). So what's going on?</p>
<p>Using a single example helps explain what one element of data looks
like, but a single example doesn't have a variance.</p>
<p>We can make the example just slightly more complete to show how
variances add.</p>
<p>Say \( A \) is \( +10 \) half the time and \( -10 \) half the
time, while \( B \) is equally likely to be \( +3 \) or \( -3
\). So \( \sigma_A^2 = 100 \) and \( \sigma_B^2 = 9 \).</p>
<p>All our squares will be positive, so we can ignore negative outcomes
by symmetry here.</p>
<p>With that simplification, notice \( A + B \) is equally likely to be
\( 10 - 3 = 7 \) or \( 10 + 3 = 13 \).</p>
<p>\[ \frac{(10-3)^2 + (10-3)^2}{2} = \frac{7^2 + 13^2}{2} = \frac{49 + 169}{2} = \frac{218}{2} = 109 = 100 + 9 = 10^2 + 3^2 \]</p>
<p>The addition and subtraction cancel out after squaring so that the
variances add.</p>
<p>This property, that \( (a+b)^2 + (a-b)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2)\), is what
makes variance decomposition work, for uncorrelated components.</p>
<p>It's simple algebra, but it's still kind of neat. Here's a geometric
illustration:</p>
<p><img alt="geometric illustration" src="geometric_illustration.jpg"></p>
<p>\[ (a-b)^2 + (a+b)^2 = b^2 + a^2 + a^2 + b^2 \]</p>
<p>Maybe this is completely intuitive for some people, but for me this
balancing of increased and decreased squares is something of a
pleasant surprise. Stop and smell the mathematical roses, you know?</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/420387/122282">also</a> a Pythagorean connection, which I think is neat, but
I haven't so far gotten it lined up with my intuition.</p>

<title>Failure to Disrupt, by Reich</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>As is especially salient during a pandemic, "technology alone can't
transform education." Reich's <a href="https://failuretodisrupt.com/">book</a> nicely wraps up the most recent
edtech hype cycle, which I was more optimistic about <a href="/2011/09/10/future-of-education/">at the time</a>. Reich thinks we have to keep <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">tinkering toward utopia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinds of edtech "learning at scale"<ul>
<li><a href="#chapter1">MOOCs</a> (instructor-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter2">adaptive tutors</a> (algorithm-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter3">open world</a> (self/peer-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter4">games</a> (aspects mostly of adaptive and open)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Challenges<ul>
<li><a href="#chapter5">difficult to get adoption</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter6">mostly helps those who least need help</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter7">complex tasks defy simple assessments</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter8">data/experiments risks/benefits</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I mostly agree with Reich, except that now I tend to put more weight
on knowledge &#224; la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch">Hirsch</a>, and I still have hope for the
application of tools like <a href="/20201009-anki_is_easy/">Anki</a> in educational settings.</p>

<h3><a name="chapter1"></a>Chapter 1: Instructor-Guided Learning at Scale: Massive Open Online Courses</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"To a first approximation, there are only two primary approaches to
teaching and learning. As Plutarch wrote in "On Listening" in the
first century CE, "Education is not the filling of a pail, but the
lighting of a fire."" (page 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reich then identifies "instructionism" and "social constructivism" as
names for these approaches, associated with Edward L. Thorndike and
John Dewey, respectively.</p>
<p>One thing I thought I noticed in edtech over the years was a trend in
which companies that focused on algorithms (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knewton">Knewton</a>) moved
toward being more like content companies over time. In a sense they
started as pail companies, but found people wouldn't buy empty pails.
Might be related to the <a href="#chapter5">adoption problem</a>.</p>
<p>This is a fun metaphor to play with. I think it might be better as
"not the stacking of wood, but the lighting of a fire." When a fire is
burning, you want to keep getting more wood. The wood is largely the
same in both approaches; the difference is the motivation or
application around it.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... teaching how to reason from evidence is one of the main
purposes of higher education, ..." (page 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"People develop self-regulated learning strategies through direct
instruction and practice, often through a long apprenticeship in
formal educational systems." (page 36)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have jokingly summarized the bulk of MOOC learning research as
proving Reich's Law: "People who do stuff do more stuff, and people
who do stuff do better than people who don't do stuff."" (page 39)</p>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<p>This is a slight contradiction to the above in that it says some stuff
is better than other stuff, but still a nice reference:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It turns out that one can have terabytes of data about what people
do online and very little understanding of what changes inside their
heads." (page 39)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since we know that most people who register for a course drop out
soon after enrollment, we start our courses with short "capsule"
units that summarize the most important ideas of the course." (page
41)</p>

<p>"Social inequality is a tenacious feature of educational systems."
(page 42)</p>

<h3><a name="chapter2"></a>Chapter 2: Algorithm-Guided Learning at Scale: Adaptive Tutors and Computer-Assisted Instruction</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... a feature of logistic curves is that when plotted against
log-transformed <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes, the S-curve becomes a linear
straight line." (page 60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem true. Maybe it means that with a log y axis, the
left and right sides are each approximately linear? I <a href="https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/1311371349957505030">tweeted</a> at
Reich about this.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading instructors sometimes discuss a transition, which happens
in about the third grade, from learning to read&#8211;learning how to
decode the sounds and meaning of text&#8211;to reading to learn&#8211;using
reading to advance content knowledge." (pages 63-64)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ritter's research team looked at how much adaptive mastery learning
teachers actually allowed in their classes, and they found that some
teachers assigned work in Carnegie Learning in such a way that it
wasn't really personalized&#8211;these teachers required students to work
on problem sets related to the topics being taught at that moment to
the whole class. By contrast, other teachers allowed students to
work at their own pace, even if this meant that some students were
still doing practice problems on topics that might have been covered
in class weeks earlier. Ritter's team found that overall learning
gains were higher in the classes where students were allowed more
opportunities to move at their own pace; in other words, the
teachers who used Carnegie Learning as intended had more learning
gains in their classrooms than did the teachers who kept their
students moving in lockstep." (page 70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes me think about whole-group single track, tracking, personalized
via computer, tutoring, and how these are thought about in different
ways...</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter3"></a>Chapter 3: Peer-Guided Learning at Scale: Networked Learning Communities</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The consensus about the great potential of personalized learning
depended on a stark disagreement about what the term actually
meant." (page 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly, this is referring to personalizing <em>pace</em> (go through the
same material but at whatever speed you like) versus personalizing
<em>content</em> (choose your own area of interest, pursue it however you
want).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... a shift in identity where the learning activity is a part of
who they are rather than something that they do ..." (page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 95, a reference to
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have
sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide &#8220;internal&#8221; guidance."
(from the abstract)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Put simply, people have a limited working memory, and when learners
allocate that working memory to solving a problem, they often are
not permanently encoding learning about the patterns and practices
that let them solve that type of problem." (page 95)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Reich raises the issue of people choosing to get involved in bad stuff
like hate groups. So total freedom in what to get into isn't
necessarily great.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Somehow, millions of people around the world find ways to teach and
learn with one another online without any formal training and
sometimes without any organization, and yet when designers try to
create these kinds of environments with intention, they encounter
substantial challenges with motivation and comprehension." (page
102)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is he deliberately avoiding the obvious interpretation from
selection/observation bias? In a whole world, some people have
motivation and comprehension to do great things. If you have a fixed
group of students that isn't skimming those people, many won't. It
seems highly likely that peer-guided learning at scale has the same
issue as other MOOCs, in that the people who benefit are
overwhelmingly people who are already doing really well to begin with.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thinking about the various ways to do whole class together vs. totally
personalized/independent learning... When I was teaching,
"differentiation" was the popular term for customizing class
activities for students who were struggling or way ahead...</p>
<p>I think really, there's some stuff that we want all students to learn,
and there are learning experiences that make sense to do with a whole
class: stuff about working in groups, communication, etc. It would be
neat to have more explicit separation between a small whole-group set
of content, and scaffolding for students to study more things on their
own.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter4"></a>Chapter 4: Testing the Genres of Learning at Scale: Learning Games</h3>
<hr>
<p>The difficulty of <em>transfer</em> (mentioned page 109) makes me wonder to
what extent transfer is related to general intelligence - or whether
they might even be largely the same thing.</p>
<p>The referenced <em>Critical Thinking: Why Is It So Hard to Teach?</em>
(<a href="https://www.readingrockets.org/article/critical-thinking-why-it-so-hard-teach">web</a>, <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf">more complete PDF</a>) is quite good.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"A more pessimistic view built upon the research on transfer is that
people who spend a lot of time playing <em>Minecraft</em> will primarily
learn about playing <em>Minecraft</em>." (page 119)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But: some reasonable notes on, for example, the general strategy of
knowing to look things up online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Domain-independent skills are slightly useful in lots of different
domains but not deeply useful in any particular domain." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"an <em>edtech Matthew effect</em> is quite common: that new technologies
disproportionately benefit learners with the financial, social, and
technical capital to take advantage of new innovations." (page 125)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Prw3xbk1Wo&amp;ab_channel=HippoCrit">Zoombinis</a> game seems kind of neat? Maybe mathier puzzles than
other puzzle games? Or not? Shrug?</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter5"></a>Chapter 5: The Curse of the Familiar</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The dilemma that Resnick and colleagues face as Scratch is widely
adopted in schools is that a variety of typical school structures
are inimical to the pedagogical philosophy behind Scratch." (page
134)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich is neglecting something that Scratch has in common with
most edtech, and which he comments on for other types: Learning with
Scratch depends hugely on the student being prepared for and/or having
characteristics that align with learning with Scratch.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Another approach from the Scratch team has been to develop decks of
physical coding cards ..." (page 138)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nostarch.com/scratchcards3">Published</a> by No Starch.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... Getting Unstuck, a twenty-one-day email-based course during
which participants received daily creative challenges, ..." (page
140)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/about">From</a> Harvard. Aha! They have <a href="https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/strategies">strategies for getting unstuck</a>!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Education technology is a good field for those who see themselves
as patient optimists." (page 147)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter6"></a>Chapter 6: The Edtech Matthew Effect</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom argues that technologists often
imagine their students as "roaming autodidacts," which she describes
as "a self-motivated, able learner that is simultaneously embedded
in technocratic futures <em>and</em> disembedded from place, culture,
history, and markets."" (page 159)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter7"></a>Chapter 7: The Trap of Routine Assessment</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Autograders excel at assessing routine tasks. These are exactly the
kinds of tasks that we no longer need humans to do." (page 171)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incomplete. There are lots of basic things that humans need to
be able to do that can be assessed automatically. But I agree that
higher-level skills are difficult to assess automatically.</p>
<hr>
<p>Reich makes an example of a plumber who installs a water heater with
an LED panel and then says on page 175: "What would it be like to
explain to the young men in that apprenticeship program that fifty
years later, plumbers would be computer programmers?" This isn't the
case. The plumber who in fact installed his water heater didn't do any
programming. This was a bad example for the point I think Reich hoped
to make.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the "reification fallacy," when we uncritically believe that
something's name accurately represents what that thing actually is."
(page 176)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat unusual way of explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)">this</a>. Interesting.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers can mostly assess what computers are good at doing, and
these are things we do not need humans to do in the labor market."
(page 197)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already commented on this, but I'll comment again: I think he's
ignoring the many things that humans should be able to do that
computers can also do. I'm thinking mostly of simple recall, where
knowing something by heart (immediately) is way better than being able
to look it up (if you even know that it exists, to look up).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter8"></a>Chapter 8: The Toxic Power of Data and Experiments</h3>
<hr>
<p>Mostly, I think Reich is pulling punches in this chapter. He doesn't
go where I thought he was going to: He doesn't really address possible
abuses of student data or the negative effects that can arise
(intentionally or accidentally) from data and experiment.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If online learning leads to better outcomes from students, it will
be through the amalgamation of a thousand or ten thousand studies
like this one that incrementally accrete a knowledge base about
effective online learning." (page 223)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich takes his "tinkering" a little too far sometimes. If
what's really needed is a bigger leap, ten thousand incremental
experiments won't necessarily get there.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion: Preparing for the Next Learning-at-Scale Hype Cycle</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In 1913, Thomas Edision declared that the age of books was about to
give way to the age of motion pictures. He told an interviewer,
"Books will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be
instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of
human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be
completely changed inside of ten years." When Edison's ten-year
prediction failed to come to pass, he simple gave himself more time.
In 1923, speaking before the Federal Trade Commission, Edison
explained, "I made an experiment with a lot of [motion] pictures to
teach children chemistry. I got twelve children and asked them to
write down what they had learned, from the [motion] pictures. I was
amazed that such a complicated subject as chemistry was readily
grasped by them to a large extent through [motion] pictures. The
parts of the [motion] pictures they did not understand I did over
and over again until they finally understood the entire [motion]
picture. I think motion pictures have just started and it is my
opinion that in 20 years children will be taught through [motion]
pictures and not through textbooks."" (pages 229-230)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was worth reading the book just for these quotes, for this
video-hater.</p>
<p>Quote Investigator has the <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/02/15/books-obsolete/">receipts</a>, as usual. And you can read
the <a href="https://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&amp;d=HR19230518.2.11">newspaper</a> for the second quote.</p>
<p>Reich mention's Khan's 2011 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education">Let's Use Video to Reinvent Education</a> on page 231 as well.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The students who tend to thrive in these kinds of environments are
those who have already demonstrated academic proficiency, since most
people develop self-regulated learning through an apprenticeship in
the formal education system." (page 235)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(As also seen on page 36.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... step change is what continuous, incremental change looks like
from a distance." (page 245)</p>

<title>Sampling can be hard to beat, for text understanding</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>If you have a lot of related documents (like thousands of reviews of a
product, or answers to a survey question) you might be tempted to use
an automatic procedure to summarize them (maybe making a word cloud,
or applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">LDA</a>, or something fancier). No automated process is
flawless, but if you need to work with many groups of documents, such
an approach could be called for. Regardless of whether you use an
automated technique, you should still start by reading a sample of
documents, and in fact reading may be the best way to understand what
people have said.</p>
<p>This is a special case of a few more general principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the data</li>
<li>Simple techniques can be very effective</li>
<li>Start with a baseline for comparison</li>
</ul>

<title>The Point of Pointless Work, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The title's not quite right, but there's some on that. <a href="https://almossawi.com/pointless-work/">It</a>'s mostly
Almossawi's personal adventures in publishing: the stories of
<a href="/20201012-bad_arguments_by_almossawi/">Bad Arguments</a> and <a href="/20201011-bad_choices_by_almossawi/">Bad Choices</a>. I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I liked the detail about publishing, including buying a pack of ten
ISBNs, and agonizing about getting pallets of books from a ship and
into Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>I also think he's right that it's good for people to do things not
just out of economic necessity, and we're fortunate when we're able to
do so.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and commentary</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anatol Rapoport has excellent advice about how to criticize. A
critic, he says, ought to begin by stating the other side's position
in a fair and objective way, then mentioning the areas of agreement,
and only then mentioning the areas of disagreement. The approach
does wonders when the goal is to turn something into a better
version of itself rather than to posture." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also found more on this in a <a href="http://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/06/16/rapoport-rules-criticism/">post</a> based on a book by Dennett
which is in my to-read pile.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was surprised to find that the copyeditors were all freelancers.
... When [prior employee copyeditors] retired, the publisher
determined that it made economic and organizational sense to
outsource that responsibility to freelancers." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another example of trying to get work done by contractors rather
than employees.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... Abraham Flexner's essay from almost a century ago on useless
knowledge." (page 100)</p>

<title>Problem Solving 101, by Watanabe</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304164/problem-solving-101-by-ken-watanabe/">book</a> by a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company">McKinsey</a> consultant "started as a simple
guide to teach Japanese schoolchildren critical thinking skills." It's
a different perspective than the more math-focused
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It">How to Solve It</a>, for example, focusing on problems of everyday
life.</p>
<h3>Watanabe's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>"understand the current situation"</li>
<li>"identify the root cause of the problem"</li>
<li>"develop an effective action plan"</li>
<li>"execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary"</li>
</ol>
<h3>P&#243;lya's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to understand the problem.</li>
<li>After understanding, make a plan.</li>
<li>Carry out the plan.</li>
<li>Look back on your work. How could it be better?</li>
</ol>
<p>From these we learn that five steps is too many steps.</p>
<p>Watanabe emphasizes a number of visual aids:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Logic tree" - break something down into sub-groups, exhaustively</li>
<li>"Yes/no tree" - a logic tree with yes/no logic, drawn as a
   flowchart</li>
<li>"Problem-solving design plan" - columns for Issue, Hypothesis,
   Rationale, Analysis/Activities, Information Source (mostly about
   understanding the problem)</li>
<li>"Hypothesis pyramid" - Boxes with arrows to show (possible)
   contributing factors for a conclusion, both for plausible reasoning
   and for deductive reasoning as appropriate</li>
<li>"Pros and cons; Criteria and evaluation" - Tables with various
   structure for pros and cons</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple times he also uses quadrant charts where the axes are impact
and effort (for prioritizing). An interesting variation is that he has
his characters think about how to <em>change</em> the required effort by
asking friends for help, etc.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and (very rarely) comments</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Being a problem solver isn't just an ability; it's a whole
mind-set, one that drives people to bring out the best in themselves
and to shape the world in a positive way." (page ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... approaches to broaden and organize one's thinking ..." (page x)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Problem solving isn't a talent limited to the lucky few. It's
actually a skill and a habit that you can learn." (page 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"People often fall into the trap of collecting information and
conducting analyses just for the sake of doing them." (page 38)</p>

the question you are trying to answer, you're probably doing
yourself more harm than good." (page 39)</p>

<title>Bad Arguments, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I wondered if there was a book of fallacies, and it turned out there
were several. Almossawi's is the cutest by far, and it's
<a href="https://bookofbadarguments.com/">freely available</a> online.</p>
<p>Thinking about fallacies is a fun way to think about how we reason,
and how we conceptualize things. There's no one correct taxonomy of
fallacies, and fallacies aren't always bad arguments. Books like this
are good for starting to access some of these ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s at the beginning of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical fallacies<ul>
<li>Formal<ul>
<li>Propositional<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Informal<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong><ul>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal<ul>
<li><strong>Not a cause for a cause</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Slippery slope</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>I think it's a good idea to organize ideas like this. It shows
clearly, for example, how many "different" fallacies are fundamentally
red herrings, according to the author. It also helps draw out that the
names of the fallacies aren't so important; in each case you could
just as well simply explain an argument's problem without using the
name.</p>
<p>It's fun to think about organizing these. Here's a different way I was
thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with premises<ul>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning</strong> (A implies A is fine; the problem is
   starting with A.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguing the wrong thing<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems with form of argument (Non Sequitur)<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
<li>Weak analogy<ul>
<li>Unrepresentative sample<ul>
<li><strong>Hasty generalization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing data<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal<ul>
<li><strong>Not a cause for a cause</strong></li>
<li><strong>Slippery slope</strong> (This is sort of an odd one out; it's
   only a fallacy if it introduces some fallacious component,
   which could just as well be identified separately.
   [<a href="http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/fallacies.html#Slippery%20slope">discussion</a>])</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unwarranted assumption<ul>
<li><strong>Composition and division</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distractions from topic<ul>
<li><strong>Argument from consequences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guilt by association</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to the bandwagon</strong></li>

<li><strong>Appeal to hypocrisy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think red herrings are generally non sequiturs, but they may not
necessarily be fallacies, in a probabilistic sense. Heck, even the
most "logical" fallacy (affirming the consequent) can still count as
evidence for a proposition.</p>
<p>Almossawi does also note on page 40 (ad hominem) "That said, there are
situations where one may legitimately question a person's credibility,
such as during trial testimony."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are
the easiest person to fool. - Richard P. Feynman"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 4, a reference to Gula's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-Herrings-Sacred-Everyday-Language/dp/1604191252/">Nonsense</a>, which might be a sort
of non-illustrated/longer version of Bad Arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That book reminded me of a list of guidelines that I had scribbled
down in a notebook a decade ago about how to argue; they were the
result of several years of arguing with strangers in online forums
and they included, for example, "Try not to make general claims
about things." That is obvious to me now, but to a schoolboy, it was
an exciting revelation." (page 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One may reasonably appeal to <em>pertinent</em> authority, as scientists
and academics typically do. A vast majority of the things that we
believe in, such as atoms and the solar system, are on reliable
authority, as are all historical statements, to paraphrase C. S.
Lewis."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> "was a British writer and lay theologian" - is
Almossawi paraphrasing him on the appeal to authority as a joke? Not
that the claim is wrong, just that it's a funny place to cite an
unrelated figure.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inductive argument: An <em>argument</em> in which if the <em>premisses</em> are
true, then it is probable that the conclusion will also be true."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what P&#243;lya calls plausible reasoning, maybe to avoid the
confusion with mathematical induction or the specific/general
explanation (which I reject) for deductive/inductive reasoning.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.livescience.com/21569-deduction-vs-induction.html">this</a> claim: "Inductive reasoning is the opposite of
deductive reasoning." is not particularly helpful. (This site is heavy
on the "deduction is general to specific, induction is specific to
general".)</p>
<p>This <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/#DedIndAbd">other</a> site has this example of induction: &#8220;John lives in
Chelsea&#8221; and &#8220;Most people living in Chelsea are rich&#8221; gives to &#8220;John
is rich.&#8221; This does not go from specific to general.</p>
<p>Plausible reasoning precedes logical reasoning (Almossawi quotes
Minsky: "Logic no more explains how we think than grammar explains how
we speak") and yet logical fallacies somewhat rudely direct us to
mistrust heuristics that are useful for plausible reasoning. This
relates to the idea of language being a model: the famous syllogism
takes "All men are mortal" as true, but really it's just highly
plausible. You really have to assume the premises.</p>
<p>In fact we could just as well speak of the Inductive Fallacy, and use
it to argue against all manner of things that are understood to be
true.</p>

<title>Bad Choices, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I enjoyed Almossawi's illustrated introduction to computational
thinking, which is <a href="https://bookofbadchoices.com/">freely available</a> online. I've been <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/198">thinking</a>
about non-fiction(ish) books for kids, and this one could be read by
middle-schoolers, I think, and possibly spark interest in learning
more. It illustrates the challenges and rewards of telling stories
about computer science topics.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s toward the end of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Asymptotic notation</li>
<li>Worst, average cases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Searching<ul>
<li>Binary search</li>
<li>Linear search</li>
<li>Hash tables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting<ul>
<li>Library sort</li>
<li>Priority queues</li>
<li>Mergesort</li>
<li>Quicksort</li>
<li>Insertion sort</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graphs<ul>
<li>Maze-solving</li>
<li>Link analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strings<ul>
<li>Huffman coding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Note that all the lines in this book are plotted on a log-log
scale, which is why the shapes of the lines are the way they are."
(page xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have liked to see this better explained. The lines are never
labeled, and I'm not sure why this was intentional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The lines in those graphs were intentionally unlabeled." (page 137)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless it was for this reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my experience, any learning environment that encourages students
to be fast learners is setting its students up for failure." (page
xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's interesting, but I'm not sure it's a good justification. At
least, I think it would be good to be explicit, like: "Add your own
labels to these," if that's what the reader is supposed to do.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you look at human history, you're likely to find that many of
the names you recognize belong to people who were educated as
apprentices rather than as note takers." (page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "to learn more" section says this is from "Most Likely to Succeed:
Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era."</p>
<hr>
<p>A glitch in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> example (starting page 69) is
corrected in the <a href="https://github.com/almossawi/badchoices/wiki/Errata">errata</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Interestingly, though, Morse determined the frequency of various
letters not by talking to experts or conducting a study or analyzing
data, but by counting the number of types in a printer's type box.
So the next time a pedant questions your research methods, take
heart." (page 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published an article recently about the
rise of scrabble champions in Nigeria, and how their winning edge
isn't necessarily due to a better vocabulary but rather to the
counterintuitive tactic of opting for shorter words." (page 80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "to learn more" section references <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-nigerian-scrabble-stars-short-tops-shorter-1463669734">For World&#8217;s Newest Scrabble Stars, SHORT Tops SHORTER</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to interpret new information in a way that fits with what
we already believe. It's what computer scientist Alan Kay calls
relativizing." (page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems sort of interesting, but I don't see a good reference for
it.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Douglas Carl Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse, has written
about the need to not only make the process of completing a set of
tasks more efficient, but also the process of questioning whether
the tasks are essential to begin with." (page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would love to find this writing!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We can't really explain a heap by analogy." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Feynman was once asked how he developed his legendary ability
to solve problems so quickly, he said that it was because he modeled
those problems in a multitude of ways, which is to say he looked at
them from different perspectives." (page 125)</p>
</blockquote>

<title>Anki is easy</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)">Anki</a>, named after the Japanese for "memorization," is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> flashcard app. I've been interested in it
before, but I didn't jump in because it seemed like a commitment to
install it and be an Anki person. It turns out you don't need to
install anything, you can use <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> for free online, so I've
started adding cards and it's fun!</p>
<p>Now I keep an <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> tab open and add things I want to remember
as I come across them. A failure mode I experienced playing with
similar software in the past was adding pre-made decks of cards from
other people, which leads to frustration and just not caring about
them. Much better to add just occasional things that you care about.</p>
<p>Now instead of just complaining about my memory, I'm also doing
something about it!</p>

<title>Fusion isn't so hard</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I saw somebody <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/amp/news/2020/10/middle-school-student-achieved-nuclear-fusion-in-his-family-playroom-631163">post</a> about a kid achieving nuclear fusion at home,
and I was sure it was fake news. It referenced <a href="https://fusor.net/">fusor.net</a>, which
also looks fake. But the concept, at least, is real!
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor">WikiPedia</a>/<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/fusion-on-a-budget">IEEE</a>) How cool! For a couple thousand dollars or
so, you can make a fusion reactor in your house, on a desk! I feel
like this should be more widely known.</p>
<p>You mostly hear about fusion in stars, which makes it seem... big. And
far away. Knowing you can do it as a hobbyist if you feel like makes
it seem so much more approachable! Together with the naturally
occurring fission <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/natures-nuclear-reactors-the-2-billion-year-old-natural-fission-reactors-in-gabon-western-africa/">reactors</a>, there are cool non-bomb, non-star
examples of both fission and fusion. Nice!</p>
<p>Also did you know you can buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium">deuterium</a>? I think you can probably
get it as a gas, but you can also just buy yourself some heavy water
if you want! It's just water, but with extra neutrons on the hydrogen!
How cool!</p>
<p>The good and bad of home fusion is that it's just a <em>little</em> bit of
fusion, and it takes a lot more energy to make it happen than you get
out. So it doesn't blow up, and the extra radioactivity won't kill you
very fast. As far as I can tell, these fusor devices are in a weird
zone of not being regulated, I think, because they're hard enough to
make and not quite dangerous enough to be a big risk.</p>
<p>I think it'd be a great thing to see more fusors in children's museums
(and other science museums). They don't have to turn it on; it'd just
be a cool exhibit to demonstrate that it's so possible.</p>

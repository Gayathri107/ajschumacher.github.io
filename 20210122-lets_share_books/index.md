# Let's share books!

Books on shelves are sad. They should be read! Please read my books.

You can browse over 500 of our household's books in two ways:

 * [a modern-ish search-based interface](https://www.librarycat.org/lib/ajschumacher)
 * [an old-looking list interface where you can see everything](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/ajschumacher)

[Contact me](/aaron/) if something catches your eye!

If you'd like, you can join [LibraryThing][] too. You can search there
through all your friends' books (add [me][]!) which is pretty neat.
You can add your books too! The LibraryThing phone app is pretty good
for easily adding books.

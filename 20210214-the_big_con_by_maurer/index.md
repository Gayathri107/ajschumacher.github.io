# The Big Con, by Maurer

Published in 1940, WWI was "the War" (page 28), WWII was "the present
European War" (page 311), there were thousand-dollar [G-notes][], and
there was quite a lot of sexism and racism (throughout). Instead of
[emails from Nigerian princes][], you might see a classified ad in the
paper "For an honest, reliable businessman with $20,000 to invest for
a large return." (page 115) There were elaborate plots! Would you
really not fall for anything like that? What are people falling for
these days? Quite a lot! What a world, what a world.

> (page 3)

 * _the wire_: "A big-con game in which the insideman (passing as a
   Western Union official) convinces the mark that he can delay the
   race results going to the book-makers long enough for the mark to
   place a bet after the race is run. The roper makes a mistake and
   the mark loses."
 * _the rag_: "An intricate big-con game very similar to the pay-off,
   except that stocks are used instead of races. The insideman poses
   as an agent for a broker's syndicate which is trying to break the
   bucket-shops. The mark profits on several investments, is sent for
   a large sum of money, and is fleeced."
 * _the pay-off_: "The most lucrative of all big-con games, with
   touches running from $10,000 up, with those of $100,000 being
   common. It operates on the principle that a wealthy mark is induced
   to believe that he has been taken into a deal whereby a large
   racing syndicate is to be swindled. At first he pays with money
   furnished him by the confidence men, then is put on the send for
   all the cash he can raise, fleeced, and blown off. The pay-off
   (invented in 1906) evolved from the short-pay at the track and was
   fully developed by 1910, when the big stores appeared in many of
   the larger cities."

> "Most marks come from the upper strata of society, which, in
> America, means that they have made, married, or inherited money.
> Because of this, they acquire status which in time they come to
> attribute to some inherent superiority, especially as regards
> matters of sound judgment in finance and investment. Friends and
> associates, themselves social climbers and sycophants, help to
> maintain this illusion of superiority. Eventually, the mark comes to
> regard himself as a person of vision and even of genius. Thus a
> Babbitt who has cleared half a million in a real-estate development
> easily forgets the part which luck and chicanery have played in his
> financial rise; he accepts his mantle of respectability without
> question; he naïvely attributes his success to sound business
> judgment. And any confidence man will testify that a real-estate man
> is the fattest and juiciest of suckers." (page 104)

The author references on page 164 "Dan the Dude's place at 28 W. 28th
St." as being a hangout for con men. It has been otherwise known as
well, [it seems][].

# Pragmatic Thinking and Learning, by Andy Hunt

This 2008 [book][] contained things both familiar and novel to me,
with a focus on creativity. One thing it describes is the
[fieldstone method][], which I think is close to my recent style of
collecting ideas. I'm trying the [morning pages][] technique the book
also describes, and I think the [inner game][] idea of teaching
awareness could be good. The book is an artifact of Hunt's experience,
drawing together and organizing ideas he'd encountered. Good stuff!

On page 2:

> "Because of this complex interaction of many interested parties and
> forces and the constant evolution of change, it seems to me that the
> two most important modern skills are these:

>  * Communication skills
>  * Learning and thinking skills"


---

> "The learning is always up to you." (page 3)

Event theories vs. construct theories is kind of an interesting
division... See e.g. [Events and Constructs][]. (Seems like
psychologists think about this distinction.)

[Events and Constructs]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03395570

---

> "The expert is very good at targeted, focused pattern matching."
> (page 21)

It's interesting how the focus on experts using intuition makes it
seem like experts are less "interpretable" than non-experts, in the
same way that neural networks are less interpretable than simpler
models.

Interesting box on page 42 about PKMzeta in the brain being important
for memory ([ref][]).

"Linear" L-mode and "Rich" R-mode as alternatives to "left brain" and
"right brain." He also calls it CPU #1 and CPU #2.

He references Guy Claxton's "Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind" which uses
"deliberate" d-mode and "undermind," Dan Pink's l-directed and
r-directed, and Betty Edwards' L mode and R mode. (page 50)

### Chapter 4: <a href="#right" name="right">Get in your right mind</a>

Emphasis on multi-sensory (even seemingly pointless multi-sensory,
like fiddling with a paperclip).

Ways to try to get ideas (etc.) from your subconscious:

 * "Image streaming" (close your eyes and describe out loud what you
   see)
 * Free-form journaling (blogging, letter-writing, etc.)
 * "Morning pages" (write three pages first thing in the morning)
 * Just write (mentions Weinberg's [fieldstone method][], which is
   close to what I try to do, I think)
 * Walking

Ideas about four repeating generation "archetypes" (hero, artist,
prophet, nomad) from Howe and Strauss, in e.g. the 2007
[The Next 20 Years: How Customer and Workforce Attitudes Will Evolve][],
which says:

[The Next 20 Years: How Customer and Workforce Attitudes Will Evolve]: https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-next-20-years-how-customer-and-workforce-attitudes-will-evolve

> "Three of those generations will still be vital forces in American
> society 20 years from now: Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials.
> Their attitudes and behaviors will have profound effects on the
> economy, the workplace, and social institutions in general. For
> example, as aging Boomers eschew high-tech medicine in favor of
> holistic self-care, natural foods, and mind-body healing techniques,
> some hospitals are opening new wings featuring alternative medicine
> and spiritual counseling. Gen Xers, having grown up in an era of

> and pragmatic as they enter midlife. Already the greatest
> entrepreneurial generation in U.S. history, they will be highly
> effective at pushing innovation, efficiency, and mass customization.
> In contrast, young adult Millennials will favor teamwork, close
> family relationships, job security, and a bland popular culture.
> Their unprecedented digital empowerment and talent for organizing
> will create a political powerhouse and may even revitalize the union

Recommends SMART goals:

 * Specific
 * Measurable
 * Achievable
 * Relevant
 * Time-boxed


---

> "Create a Pragmatic Investment Plan" (page 133)

(This refers to investing in _learning_.)


---

> "Unfortunately, relegating learning activities to your "free time"
> is a recipe for failure." (page 133)


---

On page 139 Hunt talks about Sternberg's
[Triarchic theory of intelligence][], but his description is different
from what Wikipedia says... Wikipedia says it's these three:

[Triarchic theory of intelligence]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triarchic_theory_of_intelligence

 * Componential – analytical
 * Experiential – creative
 * Practical - contextual

But Hunt says "Sternberg sees a three-part mind, composed of a
meta-level component that manages thought processes overall;
performance-based components that do tasks, make associations, and so
on; and, finally, knowledge-acquisition components that handle
assimilating new information."

Maybe these line up somehow, but I don't see it from here.

Strong praise!

Describes [SQ3R][] (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review).

[SQ3R]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R


---

On page 146, the "Test-Driven Learning" box (a play on Test-Driven
Development) talks about spaced repetition. It mentions [SuperMemo][]
and [Mnemosyne][], and references
[The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning][], which is a
pretty great ref.

[SuperMemo]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo
[Mnemosyne]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne_(software)

This is very much like [the method of Paul Halmos][].

---

> "Use a mind map to help clarify." (page 152)

Page 154 has an interesting reference to [The Prepared Mind][]: Neural
Activity Prior to Problem Presentation Predicts Subsequent Solution by
Sudden Insight:

[The Prepared Mind]: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damon_Navandi/publication/268871823_Prepared_Mind_insight/links/547a09dd0cf205d1687fab98/Prepared-Mind-insight.pdf

> "A recent study suggests that mental preparation _that involves an
> inward focus of attention_ can promote flashes of insight, even if
> the preparation occurs well in advance of facing any particular
> problem."

This reference isn't really applicable to the book's topic there
(documentation). It isn't super clear how to get the mental focus the
researchers identify, or whether we really care because it seems like
it didn't help people solve more problems, but only to be more likely
to report that they solved via a flash of insight. And the problems in
question are like "pine, crab, sauce" ("apple") so it isn't clear how
useful this is anyway.

I think Hunt is right that "it might be that _documenting_ is more
important than _documentation_" but his reference doesn't support that
claim.

---

> "we build to learn, not learn to build." (page 160)


---

> "You need to unlearn just as much as you need to learn." (page 164)

This reminds me of what Dijkstra said in
[On the cruelty of really teaching computing science][].

> ""I don't know" is a fine answer, but don't let it end there." (page

Hunt riffs on the [inner game][] to talk about increasing your
awareness to increase your feedback and improve your improvement.

> "the idea is to teach the student awareness and to use that
> awareness to correct their performance." (page 170)

> "This is a key aspect to playing the inner game: don't focus on
> correcting individual details, but just be aware. Accept _what is_
> as a first step, and just be aware of it. Don't judge, don't rush in
> with a solution, don't criticize." (page 170)

> "Don't just do something; stand there." (page 171)

> "The Inner Game series sums up this idea with the phrase, "Trying
> fails, awareness cures.""

### Chapter 8: <a href="#focus" name="focus">Manage focus</a>


---

Hunt recommends [meditation][].

[meditation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81


---

In "Defocus to Focus" (page 187) on thinking about problems
creatively:

> "it's not the idea of not doing _anything_, it's the idea of not
> doing _something_."


---

Hunt advances Dennett's ideas from [Consciousness Explained][], saying
"Multiple drafts form consciousness."

[Consciousness Explained]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained

> "That makes consciousness a bottom-up, self-organizing, perhaps even
> emergent property." (page 189)


---

> "Have you heard of the consultant's Rule of Three? In general, if
> you can't think of three ways a plan can go wrong or think of three
> different solutions to a problem, then you haven't thought it

A footnote attributes this to Jerry Weinberg's _The Secrets of
Consulting_.

---

Hunt advocates using a personal wiki.

> "The real beauty of this approach is that once you have a place to
> put a specific bit of information, you'll notice that new, relevant
> bits of data suddenly start to show up out of nowhere. It's a
> similar phenomenon to _sense tuning_."

He doesn't quite manage to say Baader-Meinhof.

The idea also aligns with the [fieldstone method][], I think.


---

> "Multitasking takes a heavy toll on productivity. One study found
> that in general, multitasking can cost you 20 to 40 percent of your
> productivity."

The "study" is footnoted as
http://www.umich.edu/~bcalab/multitasking.html, which is a collection
of links to papers... Not sure what it's referencing in particular.


---

He recommends using one of those focus apps that blocks out the
internet etc. He references "Think!" and DeskTopple. Current options
seem to be [different][].

### Chapter 9: <a href="#beyond" name="beyond">Beyond expertise</a>

This is a brief conclusion, and I mostly liked that the [author][]
wrapped up by giving his email address and inviting feedback.
